## Introduction

Regression models are widely used in various fields to predict a continuous target variable based on input features. However, finding the optimal hyperparameters for these models can be challenging. Different optimization algorithms can be used to search for the best combination of hyperparameters, which can lead to better model performance.

This repository provides examples of using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize regression models. Each algorithm is demonstrated with different regression models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Prerequisites

Before using the code snippets, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install package_name`):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - xgboost (for XGBoost examples)
  - pyswarm (for PSO optimization)
  - deap (for DE and GA optimization)

## Optimization Algorithms

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking. It aims to find the best solution by iteratively adjusting a population of particles.

### Differential Evolution (DE)

DE is an evolutionary algorithm that simulates the process of natural selection to find the best solution. It creates new solutions by combining existing solutions and adjusting them through mutation and crossover operations.

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

ACO is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It uses artificial ants to find optimal solutions by depositing pheromones on paths, allowing other ants to follow the most promising paths.

### Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)

GWO is inspired by the social hierarchy of grey wolves. It mimics the hunting behavior of wolves to find optimal solutions by dividing the population into alpha, beta, delta, and omega wolves.

### Genetic Algorithm (GA)

GA is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. It evolves a population of candidate solutions over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
